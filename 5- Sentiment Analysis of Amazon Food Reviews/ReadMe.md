### Prepare the dataset
You need to download the `Reviews.csv` file (300.9 MB) from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?select=Reviews.csv).
It will give a zip file that you need to extract it to the `./data/` folder, and use the provided code to practice creating the classifier.
The file/folder structure would be like this:  
ðŸ“¦Sentiment_Analysis_of_Amazon_Food_Reviews  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚data  
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œReviews.csv  
 â”£ ðŸ“œReadME.md  
 â”— ðŸ“œanalysis.ipynb  

 Now you can follow the `analysis.ipynb` to practice sentiment classification.
